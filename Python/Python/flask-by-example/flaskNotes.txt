“When installing Postgresql with Flask on Mac” 
-IF getting the egg-info 1 error just use Brew and choose below

brew install postgresql
//To run at any time run below after install
postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres

//Run this if the above don’t work for psql 
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start


THIS IS THE ANSWER THE FINALLY WORKED FOR ME
//Can also use this to open sql from the command line in flask env
createdb
//then
psql -h localhost

//To quite the PSQL database use 
\q



//REMEMBER FOR THIS FLASK STUFF, AFTER EVERY NEW INSTALL I SEEM TO RUN THIS COMMAND 
pip freeze > requirements.txt

//Command to initialize Alembic to run migrations 
python manage.py db init

//Run python migrates 
python manage.py db migrate
